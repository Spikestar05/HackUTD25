# 🧠 Our Inspiration

Buying a car can be overwhelming especisally with so many models, trims, and features to choose from, it’s easy for customers to feel lost. We wanted to simplify that experience by creating an interactive and personalized way to build and discover your ideal Toyota.
Our inspiration came from the idea of a virtual car studio, where users can start with a base model, visually customize it part by part, and let smart technology guide them toward the vehicle that best matches their needs and dreams.

# 🚗 What Does It Do?

Our solution starts with a generic Toyota car model that users can click on to customize specific parts, from wheels and interiors to color, performance, and technology features.

As users make choices, the system intelligently matches their preferences with Toyota’s real vehicle lineup to recommend the best-fit model based on features, price range, and financing options.

Additionally, through ElevenLabs voice integration, users can simply describe their dream car out loud. For example, “I want a sporty hybrid SUV with great fuel economy and a sunroof” and the app will instantly analyze the request and recommend the Toyota vehicle that fits those preferences.

The result is a fun, immersive, and personalized car discovery experience that helps people find their perfect Toyota effortlessly.
